# TAS5805m
This driver has a minimal config that works with the TAS5805m, the TAS5825m and the TAS5828m, probably also with the other members of this family of audio amplifiers with DSP. For full configuration 3 different binary firmwares for DSP rates have to be created from TI's PPC3 output. A Device Tree overlay for the Raspberry Pi with i2creg=<> and firmware="" is also provided.
